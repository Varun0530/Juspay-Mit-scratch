Key Features
Hero Feature
The Hero Feature enables dynamic character interactions.
When two sprites collide, their animations are interchanged, offering a new layer of interactivity.
Hero Feature Implementation:
Motion:

Characters can move horizontally or vertically.
Ability to rotate in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
Move to specific coordinates on the canvas.
Control:

Repeat a block action for a set number of iterations.
Implement delay between block actions using a wait function.
Other Features:
Create and manage multiple sprites.
Select an active sprite to execute block actions on.
Design custom runnable blocks.
Drag and drop to add or remove blocks within a function.
This project replicates the visual programming experience of Scratch, empowering users to create animations and interactions by using blocks to control the behavior of sprites.
